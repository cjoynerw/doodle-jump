<h2>We all know the game Doodle Jump from our childhood so I decided to make a clone of it using the web design basics: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.</h2><br />
<h3>Controls:</h3><br />
Left Arrow = Move left<br />
Right Arrow = Move right<br />
Up Arrow = Stop moving<br />
*As of now, there is no restart button(yet) so just refresh the page to reset the game!*
